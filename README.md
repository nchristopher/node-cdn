### Intro

If you are *not* using a Content Delivery Network 
[CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) 
for your web projects. Take some time to watch this Video on 
How CDNs Work: http://youtu.be/WTlweLma3Vc

The cost of using a CDN has decreased greatly in the past few years due to increased competition.

There are several great CDN Providers out there; the main ones are:

- [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com) (the industry leader) 
- [NetDna](http://www.netdna.com/pricing/) - almost as fast as Akamai but with transparent pay-as-you-go pricing. But there's a minimum fee of $800 per month!! Not exactly Boot Strap sort of Money...!
- [RackSpace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud-files/) - Uses Akamai's technology but offers pay-as-you-go pricing (quite a lot more expensive than Amazon's Cloudfront)
- [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com/pricing) - decent but annoying annual pricing and "overage" charges

For a **Report** on **CDN Performance and Availability** visit: http://www.cedexis.com/country-reports/ (click on the "CDNs" tab on the main menu) shows clearly that you **get more** when you **pay more**. But for our purposes using Amazon's S3 and CloudFront will provide a *massive* boost to any NodeJS (or *any* other Web App!) that we might as well get started!
